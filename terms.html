With delivery of the Product, StyleTheory will provide you with a pre-paid, pre-addressed StyleTheory carrying case, box or mailing envelope (as the case may be) as well as instructions for your use in returning the Products to StyleTheory (“Return Packaging”).

        <p>RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCTS. Upon delivery, you bear responsibility for the Product(s). You acknowledge that a Secure Shipping Address is highly recommended.

Normal wear and tear encompasses minor stains, rips, missing beads, stuck zippers or other minor damages. If you return a Product that is damaged beyond normal wear and tear, then you agree that we shall charge you, and you shall pay, for the price for repairing or replacing the Product, as determined in our discretion, up to the Retail Value for the Product.</p>

        <p>A. Terms And Conditions</p>
        <p>SUBSCRIPTION. You will be entitled to rent up to three (3) Products at any time from a range of Products designated on the Site, as more fully described here. Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including payment of fees) and our right to terminate the subscription, we do not impose any limitations on the time period during which you may keep any Product we have sent to you. Because subscription is a beta, membership is limited and may not always be available.</p>
        <p>FEES. Upon subscription, StyleTheory will charge you a pre-paid subscription fee or a monthly subscription fee that will automatically renew and you will be billed every 30 days at the then current fee to your payment method on file. After a pre-pay period ends, your subscription membership will automatically renew and you will be billed every 30 days at the then current fee to your payment method on file. The current monthly subscription fee is set out here, but is subject to change at our discretion and any such change will be effective for any subsequent renewal subscription period. You hereby authorise StyleTheory or our third party payment processor to charge your payment card for the applicable subscription fee on a monthly or recurring pre-pay basis until you cancel. The subscription fees include shipping and limited insurance, covering minor mishaps but not significant damage, loss or theft. Subscription fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth below. Taxes may apply on the subscription fees.</p>
        <p>CANCELLATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP. There are no refunds to a pre-paid membership. Your monthly subscription automatically renews and you will be billed every 30 days. To cancel your monthly membership,email us at hello@styletheory.co. You must return your Products before the end of your current bulling period (located in account settings) to avoid additional fees. If StyleTheory does not receive your Products by the end of your billing period in which you want to cancel your membership, StyleTheory will charge you the full retail price of each Product.</p>
        <p>DELIVERY. All deliveries will be through StyleTheory's shipping partners, which may change from time to time at our discretion. The shipping method used will be at the discretion of StyleTheory. We will provide you with information about estimated delivery and arrival times of Products through the Site or App. The Products we send to you will be professionally cleaned and delivered ready to wear. Our dry cleaning partner professionally cleans, sterilizes and inspects each Product we send to you, but use of the Products is at your own risk and StyleTheory or our dry cleaning partner shall not be held liable for any health-related complaints associated with any Product.</p>
        <p>RETURNS. With each shipment of Products we send you, we will include one Return Packaging (which may be our StyleTheory box – as defined in section 2(b)), which you can use to return all of the Products you currently have. We will use reasonable efforts to send you new Products promptly upon processing your return, but you acknowledge that as a result of processing and delivery, there will be a delay between your return of a Product and receipt of a new Product. You agree to return the Products using the Return Packaging, including the StyleTheory box (as defined in Section 2(B)).</p>
        <p>ADDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS. Without limiting the application of the rest of these Terms, all of your obligations set out under Sections 2(A) and (B), including but not limited to the obligations relating to receipt and care of Products, apply to your participation.</p>
        <p>DAMAGE, FAILURE TO RETURN PRODUCTS. Unless you cancel your subscription, it will automatically renew on a monthly or recurring pre-pay basis. You expressly authorize us to collect the applicable subscription fee and any taxes, using any payment card on record for you, in connection with any such auto-renewal. You may cancel your subscription or find out more information about your subscription, including your monthly or recurring pre-pay renewal date, by contacting hello@styletheory.co. As soon as you cancel, you will not be eligible to receive any additional Products. You may continue to keep Products you have already received, but you must return to StyleTheory all such Products on or before the last day of the applicable subscription period during which you cancel. If we don't receive your items on time, you will be charged up to the full retail price. You will not be entitled to any refund of subscription fees.</p>
        <p>CHANGES TO AND TERMINATION OF SUBSCRIPTION. As subscription is a beta program, we reserve the right to modify (including the subscription fee) or terminate your subscription at our sole discretion. If we terminate your subscription, we will provide you with, as determined in our sole discretion, either (a) a prorated refund for the remainder of your current applicable subscription, or (b) continued access for the remainder of that applicable period, in accordance with these Terms. However, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that, in our discretion, violates any terms set out in these Terms or any applicable law. If we choose to provide you with continued access for the remainder of that applicable period of your subscription, you will continue to have access during that period, except that we will not send you any Products within ten (10) days of the end of that period. Prior to the end of that period (or, if we do not provide you with continued access, immediately upon our termination of your subscription), you must also return to StyleTheory all Products you have received.</p>

        8. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
      </header>
      <p>This Section 8 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>
      <div class="terms-block__point">
        <p>A. Informal Process First</p>
        <p>You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and StyleTheory, you will first contact StyleTheory and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="terms-block__point">
        <p>B. Arbitration Agreement</p>
        <p>After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of StyleTheory's Services and/or Products, or relating in any way to StyleTheory's communications with you, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and StyleTheory. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by StyleTheory for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Services that (including the Site and App) that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL YOU MAY OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE FIRST OF THE DATE YOU ACCESS THIS SITE OR APP OR THE DATE YOU RECEIVE ANY SERVICES BY FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE DESCRIBED BELOW.</p>
        <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the Singapore Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and StyleTheory are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
        <p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to StyleTheory Private Limited. The arbitration shall be administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the SIAC's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the SIAC's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The SIAC's rules are available at www.siac.org.sg.</p>
        <p>The number of arbitrators shall be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Singapore law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
        <p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the SIAC's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to Section 8(C) below.</p>
        <p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with StyleTheory and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legalinfo@styletheory.co within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access the Site or App or the date you receive any Services.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="terms-block__point">
        <p>C. Class Action Waiver</p>
        <p>Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator shall not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</p>
        <p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and StyleTheory each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
